Dear Hiring Manager,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to express my interest in any available on-site roles as a Python Developer or DevOps Engineer. I recently completed a 6-month internship where I worked on backend development, automation, and cloud deployment. I also built a WhatsApp chatbot using Python and integrated it with real-time APIs.

I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your team and grow in a challenging environment.

Please find my resume attached for your reference. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
